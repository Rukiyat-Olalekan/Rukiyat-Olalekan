      <h2>ABOUT RUKIYAT OLALEKAN</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! I have always been passionate about
        science and pursued a degree in Chemistry with the belief that it would
        shape my future. However, I used to fear technology and shy away from
        it. Over time, I challenged myself to overcome this fear and explore the
        world of technology. As Aristotle wisely said, "We are what we
        repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." This quote
        resonated with me and encouraged me to put in the effort to conquer my
        fears. <br />
        <br />
        My curiosity led me to delve into web development, and it has been an
        incredible journey. I discovered that with determination and dedication,
        technology is not as daunting as it seems. I found great joy and
        fulfillment in learning to code and working on web projects. On this
        website, you will find examples of my expertise in web development.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />I strive to create outstanding designs, seamless user experiences,
        and innovative solutions for every project I undertake. Drawing on my
        scientific background, I bring a unique perspective to technology.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not coding, you will find me engaged in reading or exercising
        because I firmly believe an active body nurtures an active mind. I invite you
        to join me on this exciting exploration as we bridge the worlds of
        science and technology. Let's collaborate and push the boundaries
        together, creating meaningful and impactful experiences.
